Mission
--------
There is a powerful data analytics tool called Jupyter. We are trying to improve the revision control experience in Jupyter by adding native, file-level revisioning. The source control process will be largely transparent to the users, and the users will be able to tag significant points in the history of a document, and will have the ability to navigate between, rearrange, and modify these tagged points.

Sponsor

This project is sponsored by Professor Alva Couch.

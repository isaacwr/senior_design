Mission
--------
We are building a simplified source control tool to help introduce new programmers 
to the concepts and best practices of using revision control systems. Our tool is 
going to support the essential operations for source control: push/pull, commit/amend, 
and rollback. In addition we are incorporating web-based code review and collaboration. 
This project is targeted at new programmers, typically in college, who are starting to 
work on multi-developer projects for the first time.

Sponsor
-------
We do not have a sponsor yet, but are currently in the process of asking a couple
of Tufts professors if they are interested in sponsoring us.

10/20/17 meeting
Kalina, Elena, Isaac, Alva

Issues to bring up
------------------
- Feedback on our collaboration workflow
- How do we paste live updates into an editor? Would we need to make a 
  custom editor? Would we need to use an online editor?
- Bring up cloud-9
- Next steps for pair programming idea
   - more storyboarding
   - requirements
- General Jupyter questions
   - Why can't we use tradition rcs

Feedback / Brainstorming on Collaborative Coding Editor
------------------------------------------------
Technical details:
- Will want to build a website to handle file editing. Desktop app will be too hard to make flexible / extend to other platforms.
- Operational transformation for live updates needs a byte level anchor on each boundary for the start/end
    - Will preserve the byte offset (that's how the algorithm works)

How to make it more meaningful / unique:
- We could maybe build one that syncs to your local repository easily
- Might be interesting enough to make a website where you can edit the snippets of code (jupyter delegates this by specifying the snippets as being the blocks)
- More interesting would be to see how to set aside a block for collaborative editing
    - Could have subrange editing / delegation; can limit what people can do in those areas (eg: "hey, come help me with this")

What already exits:
- Cloud 9 - but no easy sync / export to local
- Github already has a solution to the checking out a piece of code: you just put it in a separate module (file)
- We can modify the commit command to set a scope for the commit; ie rejects any changes that are not within the range you specify
    - As long as you dont need to see what the other person is doing, we just use the subrange commit filter
- ** Every approach except jupyter has modularity; jupyter just has a linear codebase

Problems:
- We would have to find out how to make groups / group commits in git because that does not exist right now
- Our vision for collaborative/pair programming is ultimately not useful, since you almost never need or even want multiple people typing live at the exact same time. 
    - As a teaching tool, it is much more meaningful to follow the pilot-copilot model of pair programming (see below)

N-way Pilot-Copilot Idea
-------------------------------------------
N-way pilot-copilot approach (N copilots watching one pilot type and explain things) is cool, especially if you can flip the cursor and have someone else take over the cursor and contribute, with everyone with their headsets on to talk
- Only one person can program at once, only one person can modify the program
    - ** This is not an operational transformation problem, it's a token passing problem

- We use precondition/postcondition to verify subroutines... hard for people to pair program because they might have different ways to satisfy the post conditions
- Our approach could have different sections, where each section has a coder and some observers (and some markers), and you can click around and interact with the sections
    - Would follow operational transformations to update that that

Notes on Jupyter/JupyterHub (We are not planning on continuing with this project)
--------------------------------------------
Jupyter
- Executable code, in its own sandbox
- Allows you to write a document that prints and reads like a document but that contains executable code that can generate things (figures, tables, etc)
    - Because of that, it's not stored as a file, it's stored as a database
    - It's a 1D database with mixed mode blocks (eg: python block, fully formatted HTML text, etc)
    - Used to write papers in data science that contains code that backs up what you're saying

JupyterHub is the shared version, collaborative
- Would be cool if you could click inside a box and be able to talk about what you're doing in that box
** iPython cant talk to your local disk; it fakes it, if you have to do disk operations and stuff

To Do for Next Time
-------------------------------------------
- Do a literature survey of the sites we know that do similar things
- Investinate various parities of pair programming that might have version control
- Give Alva a matrix of our findings

Where’s the value?
------------------
	- pair programming (with many people) from afar
	- integrated idea of the project instead of thinking it as a bunch of
	different things

What do we want to keep that’s currently in git?
------------------------------------------------
	- value in being able to break off from the stream

Possible ideas:
---------------
	- use transactional approach to pair program on a defined section. 
	when done, convert to diff.
	- continue on using differential algo

Things to do:
-------------
	work through a user centeric workflow 
		- stories/use cases: what goes on with a system (what the user should do)
		- requirements: things the system should do to support this
		- design: what the program will look like
	spend some time on Jupiter - get a free account
		- finish all the readings

Don’t put the tech first, put the uses first
Integrating git into jupiter isn’t an easy project
	- a jupiter page is not a file, it’s a set of database entires 
	(which is not simple)

Things to think about
----------------------
	- how do we keep people from interacting with ugly git commands
	- could we use time travel? (interact with timeline instead of git)
	- could we have freezes?
	- can we integrate git into jupiter
